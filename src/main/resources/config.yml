# Maximum eyes one player can contribute to a single portal structure
# Automatically clamps to range between 0 and 12 (though why would you pick 0??)
max_eyes_per_player: 3

# Distance semantics:
# - Distances below 0 (e.g. -1) are treated as unlimited range, ignoring dimension.
#   In other words, presence in server is enough to trigger the effects.
# - All distances are 3D Euclidean distance from the portal center.

# Maximum distance (in blocks) committed players may be from the portal for it to remain open
activation_radius: 16.0
# Maximum distance (in blocks) a committed player may be from the portal to receive action bar updates
action_bar_radius: 60.0
